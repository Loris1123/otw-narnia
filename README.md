# otw-narnia

Narnia is a wargame on OverTheWire. You can play it at https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/

Since the tools on the systems of OverTheWire are outdated and I did not find any page where I can download the complete sources, I decided to publish them here.

## Compile instructions

```
gcc -o narnia0 -fno-stack-protector -m32 narnia0.c
```

Since I have not played all levels, I can not promise the instructions work for all.
